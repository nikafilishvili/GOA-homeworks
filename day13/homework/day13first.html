    <p>At its core, football is a simple yet dynamic sport played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players, including a goalkeeper. The objective is straightforward: to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.</p>

    <p>Matches are typically played on a rectangular field with goals at each end. The field is divided into two halves, and teams switch sides after halftime. Players use their feet, head, or torso to move the ball around the field, except for the goalkeeper who can also use their hands within the penalty area.</p>

    <p>Football is not just about physical prowess; it's a game of strategy, skill, and teamwork. Players must possess a combination of technical abilities such as dribbling, passing, shooting, and tackling, as well as tactical awareness to outsmart their opponents.</p>
